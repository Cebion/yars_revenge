Yar's Revenge
=============

Written by Paul Robson

A quick remake of the Atari 2600/VCS Game created by Howard Scott Warshaw.

Keys : Arrow Keys to move, Left Control to fire.

How to play
===========

After having installed it, run it with the command yar

Move your Yar around with the arrow keys, fire chunks out of the shield with your fire key
(control). You can't shoot anything else. You can also eat bits of the shield by ramming it.
When you've done this enough the cannon appears at the left side and can be used to aim at the
quotile (the triangular thing on the right) to destroy it to end the game.

Avoid the cannon yourself, the destroyer missile that chases you, and the quotile that
attacks you from time to time.

In the zone (the flashy bit) the destroyer missile can't get you, but you can't fire either.
